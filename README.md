Worksheet 1

1. Adapt the stack solution for double values by developing a class called
DoubleStack and write a main method that performs the following operations:
Push(3.2), Pop(), Push(4.2), Push(3.0), Push(2.6), Pop(), Push(1.2), Pop(),
Pop()

3. Adapt the stack solution for char values by developing a class called
CharStack and write a main method that performs the following operations:
Push(‘Y’), Push(‘P’), Push(‘P’), Push(‘A’), Push(‘H’), Pop(), Pop(), Pop(),
Pop(), Pop()
Print out each value that is popped using System.out.print(...). What does this

comment at the start of the main() method containing your answer.
